"""Useful container classes.

According to Stroustrup:
(http://www.research.att.com/~bs/glossary.html#Gcontainer)

container - (1) object that holds other objects. (2) type of object that
holds other objects. (3) template that generates types of objects that
hold other objects. (4) standard library template such as vector, list,
and map.

Find herein the containers: warehouse and Graph.

def warehouse(stock, factory=None):
    """warehouse(stock, factory=None) -> iavailable, iremainder.
    
    Iterate over stock, extending as needed. Once the 'stock' sequence is
    exhausted, the factory function is called to produce a new valid object
    upon each subsequent call to next().
    
    If factory is None, the class of the first item in the sequence is used
    as a constructor. Otherwise, the factory function does not receive any
    arguments, so if your class has mandatory arguments to __init__,
    wrap the class in a function which can supply those.
    
    The most common use for warehouse is to reuse a set of existing
    objects, often because object creation and/or destruction is expensive.
    
    Example:
    
    available, remainder = warehouse(seq)
    for line in order:
        line.use(available.next())
    for item in remainder:
        item.close()
